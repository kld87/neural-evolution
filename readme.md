## Info

This is an "evolution simulator" for cells that have to move, eat, and reproduce to survive. Each cell's behaviour is based on its neural network. It can take a while (30m+) for a viable species to come into existence, especially on a slow PC.

## Disclaimer

I just dug up this code and wanted to save it before it was lost. It was my first Java program in probably 8 years and my first kick at writing a NN, so needless to say it's a bit of a mess and not a good example of my abilities in either subject.

## Usage

* javac *.java
* java Main
